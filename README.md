# Forecasting Household Electricity Usage


# ðŸ§  Project Overview

## Problem Area

With the increasing urgency around climate change and energy sustainability, improving residential energy efficiency is a critical focus. In many households, energy usage patterns are not monitored or optimized, leading to wastage, increased costs, and higher carbon footprints. Smart grids and energy-aware applications can help users understand and adjust their energy consumption habitsâ€”but only if theyâ€™re powered by meaningful insights derived from real-world data.

This project explores the problem of **inefficient household energy consumption**, aiming to uncover patterns, peak usage times, and potential areas for conservation.

**Stakeholders impacted include:**
- Homeowners seeking to reduce energy bills.
- Utility companies planning demand response strategies.
- Policy-makers designing energy incentives or rebates.
- Smart home system developers.

## Proposed Data Science Solution

This project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series modeling, and machine learning to:
- **Understand** household energy consumption patterns across days, weeks, and seasons.
- **Predict** future energy usage at different times of day.
- **Detect anomalies** that may indicate wasteful or unusual consumption.
- **Recommend** actionable energy-saving insights based on consumption behaviors.

Potential deliverables may include:
- A predictive model for household energy usage.
- Visual dashboards summarizing usage trends and alerts.
- Scenario-based energy-saving recommendations.

## Impact of the Solution

This solution aims to:
- Empower individuals with personalized, data-driven energy insights.
- Support utility providers with demand forecasting and load balancing.
- Inform broader sustainability goals by contributing to more efficient energy use at the household level.
- Lay groundwork for future integration with smart home and IoT systems that automate energy optimization.

## Dataset Descriptions

The dataset used is the **UCI Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Data Set**. It contains over **2 million measurements** gathered from a single household in Sceaux, France between **December 2006 and November 2010**.

### Key Characteristics:
- Data is collected in **1-minute intervals**, resulting in high granularity.
- The dataset is rich enough to enable time series modeling and seasonality detection.
- Missing values and noisy readings are present, requiring cleaning and preprocessing.
